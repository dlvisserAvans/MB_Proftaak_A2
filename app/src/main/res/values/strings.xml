    <string name="fairytail_avanius"> King Avanius lived in a kingdom far away from here. It was a great and rich kingdom. Everyone was happy and everyone had work. King Avanius took good care of his people, giving money from his own treasure house to those who needed help.
                                        But one day there was a problem. King Avanius had forgotten the password of his treasury, he could not open it anymore! King Avanius was so sad that he could no longer help his people that he immediately set out on a great quest. For if he ever forgot the password, he had hidden clues at various places in the wonder forest. But King Avanius was already old and can no longer embark on the adventure himself. Hence, he gathered the bravest adventurers from all over the country. To find the password together and let the wealth flow back into the kingdom.</string>
